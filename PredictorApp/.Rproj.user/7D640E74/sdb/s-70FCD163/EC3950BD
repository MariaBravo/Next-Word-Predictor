This approach searches on the fly entire paragraphs using regular expressions.  \ne.g. sentence:  \"love my family\":  \n            regexp: \".{0,1}\\\\blove\\\\b.{0,1}\\\\bmy\\\\b.{0,1}\\\\bfamily\\\\b\" </small>   \n<h6 align=\"left\">\n <font face=\"Times\" color=\"blue\">\nWhere {0,1} are parameters used to tune the distance between the sentence words when the algorithm is looking into the file paragraphs. </font>\n</h6>\n\n\nUsing n-gram frequency tables\n========================================================\n\n![alt text](screenNGRAMS.jpg)\n\nSearching into raw unprocessed text files\n========================================================\n\n![alt text](screenRAW.png)\n\nWill you stop the sea tides with a blanket?\n========================================================\n- Language is alive and the change is always coming.\n- We can not build static structures as dictionaries. Who can establish which words should be filtered?. What is a foreign word in the global village?. Twitter is teaching us better.\n- Graphic symbols as emoticons belong to the language in use. Excluding stop words? According to the n-gram files built for this project the word \"the\" represents more than 6% of the entire English corpora.\n- The scanning of raw text files implemented in the second algorithm provides a more efficient solution to the word prediction problem. A corpora feeding on \nreal-time data stream will be able to deliver answers fitted to the timeline.\n- About statistical evidence, because of time restrictions the test scripts (coded in Python) have not been finished. But the running application shows the difference between both approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
